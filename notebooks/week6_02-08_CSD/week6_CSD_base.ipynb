    "Individual neurons act as sources and sinks of current forming dipole moments. Depending on the anatomy of the given brain region being recorded from, neurons are often aligned forming larger cumulative dipoles that are picked up by the recording electrode. If the dipole moment for two neurons are not aligned this can effectively cancel out. Fortunately, cortex has fairly regular laminar structure with many neurons having similar alignments. When a neuron receives input at its dendrites and channels open allowing positively chareged ions in this leads to a negative deflection in the extracellularly recorded potentials (called a current sink), and the extracellular space farther away from this sink will be more positive and will be a source for return current (current source). <i>\n",

    "The activity at recording electrodes reflects a mixture of local activity and activity from neighboring sources that can propogate via the conductive media of the brain. We want to reduce this volume conducted signal to identify local positive (sources) and negative (sinks) in the LFP signal which can reflect localized neural activity. To address this issue, we can simply take the spatial derivative, the change in voltage per distance, given the known spacing of contact sites. This is typically called current source density analysis when applied to multicontanct probes in the brain and has been used to identify local activity patterns associated with laminar processing.

The larger the filter order, the better the filter frequency precision although this comes at a drawback of increased computation time and creates a shift in the phase of the signal (this can be corrected for so it is not a big deal).

Although dubious, it is often the case that groups will extend/duplicate the data from the top and bottom electrodes under the assumption that the voltage recorded at nearby electrodes is not drastically different and therefore will not greatly impact the estimation. We will avoid doing this here and will simply lose data on both of these channels.\n",
