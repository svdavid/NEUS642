NEUS 642 Week 3: Getting started with pandas and dataframes

To get started:
* Make sure you have the latest version of the course materials:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `git pull`
* Error when you try to pull?  Might you have already edited one of the week 2 notebook files? If so you need to revert any changes:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `cd notebooks/week3_01-18_pandas`
  * `git checkout -- *`
  * `git pull`
* Still having trouble?  See [detailed discussion of reverting git repositories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1146973/how-do-i-revert-all-local-changes-in-git-managed-project-to-previous-state)
* Open `notebooks/week3_01-19_pandas/Week3_dataframes_homework_students.ipynb` in Jupyter and work through the exercises.
