    "# Plot a tuning curve with error bars\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency tuning curve we generated in class plots the mean spike rate response to each distinct stimulus, but it doesn't indicate which of those *responses are signficantly different from the spontaneous spike rate*. We want to determine which stimulus frequencies evoke a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics primer:** One quick way to assess significance is to measure the standard error on the mean (SEM), which is the standard deviation across a list of samples $(x)$, divided by the square root of the number of samples. Important detail for computing statistics on real data: estimating standard deviation and SEM requires a \"degree of freedom\" (DOF) correction, which means dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$ (The basic intuition for this correction is that you need one DOF in your n data points to estimate the mean, $m$, so you only have $n-1$ left to compute variance/SEM):\n",
    "\n",
    "$SEM = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-1}} \\sqrt{(\\sum_i^n{(x(i)-m)^2} / (n-1))} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sqrt{(\\sum_i^n{(x(i)-m)^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple rule of thumb, the measurement of a mean value is signficant with $p<0.05$ if it is at least **2 SEM** from baseline. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Another note/warning(!!)** SEM works if your data samples are *independent and normally distributed*. Because we randomly varied the order of stimulus presentation, we can pretty safely assume the samples are independent. \"Normal\" means the distribution can be described by a Gaussian function. Spiking activity isn't normal, but let's assume it is today. We'll learn more about non-parametric statistics, which are better for analyzing spiking and other biological data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, let's stick with SEM. Using `numpy`, we can compute SEM with the `np.std` function. Use the `ddof` parameter to include the degrees-of-freedom correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will do three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the spontaneuous spike rate for a neuron as a measure of baseline.\n",
    "2. Compute the mean and SEM response to each tone (include 1-degree of freedom correction)\n",
    "3. Plot the mean response to each tone with error bars to indicate whether 2 SEM do or do not overlap with the spont rate."
