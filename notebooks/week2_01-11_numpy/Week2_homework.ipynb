    "The frequency tuning curve we generated in class plots the mean spike rate response to each distinct stimulus, but it doesn't indicate which of those *responses are signficantly different from the spontaneous spike rate*. We want to determine which stimulus frequencies evoke a response.\n",

    "**Warning!** SEM works if your data samples are *independent and normally distributed*. Because we randomly varied the order of stimulus presentation, we can pretty safely assume the samples are independent. \"Normal\" means the distribution can be described by a Gaussian function. Spiking activity isn't normal, but let's assume it is today. We'll learn more about non-parametric statistics, which are better for analyzing spiking and other biological data later.\n",
