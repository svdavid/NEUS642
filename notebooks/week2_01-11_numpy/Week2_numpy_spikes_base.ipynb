If preferred, you may work in small groups of two to three people. You are expected to be in regular contact with the course staff as you develop the exercise so that we can guide you and ensure the exercise is of appropriate scope and level for the class.

    "## Introduction: Getting started with numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we dip our toes in the waters of numerical processing.\n",
    "`numpy` (\"Numerical Python\") is a core library used in pretty much any analysis written in Python. It implements a number of basic linear algebra routines, with the idea that mathmatical operations can be applied to time series and arrays of numbers, similarly to variables in standard programming. Conceptually, numpy borrows substantially from the numerical core of Matlab, which itself is built on the venerated LINPACK library.\n",
    "\n",
    "`matplotlib` is a widely used plotting library, which also has its roots in Matlab. Many other plotting libraries exist, and many make prettier pictures. However, matplotlib can usually get the job done. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the use of basic numpy and matplotlib functions, we'll perform basic analysis of neural spike data recorded from auditory cortex. There are a few quirks around plotting auditory tuning curves that take advantage of optional features in matplotlib, e.g., as tweaking the details of the x axis. While you may not use these specific options all the time, they provide examples of how you can often find little features to make your plots prettier and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auditory neurophysiology experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "An auditory neurophysiology experiment consists of recording neural activity during the presentation of one or more sounds. A goal of these studies is to understand what aspects of the sound input, $x(t)$, evokes changes in neural activity, $y(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/auditory_ephys_cartoon.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The function (or \"encoding model\") $h$ that describes the relationship between $x$ and $y$ can be very complex, but today things are simple. In the current dataset, single-neuron spiking activity is recorded from primary auditory cortex (A1) of a ferret during presentation of a sequence of pure tones of varying frequency. We'd like to know how spiking activity varies as a function of the tone frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuning curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example frequency tuning curve, which shows the average spike rate evoked by tones of different frequencies for a single neuron in auditory cortex. The tuning curve provides a clear and simple characterization of the range of tone frequencies that drive a neural response, that is, a neuron's receptive field.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tuning_curve_example.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spike rasters\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a spike raster for the same neuron, which gives more information about the dynamics of spontaneous and sound-evoked activity. Ticks in each row show the time of spikes during a single tone presentation. This plot is complex in that data from mulitple different tones are stacked on top of each other. Note that responses to different tones can vary in time, sometimes occuring only transiently after tone onset and sometimes sustained over the duration of the tone.\n",

The most comprehensive is to specify the RGB (red-green-blue) HEX code (https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html). To help, we'll get a list of the automatic color cycle from `matplotlib`. You'll want spont rate for neuron 1 plotted in `color_set[0]` and spont rate for neuron 2 in `color_set[1]`. The `plt.rcParams` dictionary gives you access to many, many parameters that control the look and feel of matplotlib plots.
