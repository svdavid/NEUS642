NEUS 642 Week 2: Basics of analysis with numpy and matplotlib

To get started:
* Make sure you have the latest version of the course materials:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `git pull`
* Error when you try to pull?  Might you have already edited one of the week 2 notebook files? If so you need to revert any changes:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `cd notebooks/week2_01-12_numpy`
  * `git checkout -- *`
  * `git pull`
* Still having trouble?  See this [detailed discussion of reverting git repositories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1146973/how-do-i-revert-all-local-changes-in-git-managed-project-to-previous-state)
* Open and complete the exercises in [Week2_numpy_homework_students.ipynb](Week2_numpy_homework_students.ipynb) in Jupyter.
