NEUS 642 Week 6: Permutation statistics and digging deeper into functions.

To get started:
* Make sure you have the latest version of the course materials:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `git pull`
* Error when you try to pull?  Might you have already edited one of the week 2 notebook files? If so you need to revert any changes:
  * `cd <my_NEUS_git_path>`
  * `cd notebooks/week6_02-13_permutation`
  * `git checkout -- *`
  * `git pull`
* Still having trouble?  See [detailed discussion of reverting git repositories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1146973/how-do-i-revert-all-local-changes-in-git-managed-project-to-previous-state)
* Open [permutation_stats_student.ipynb](permutation_stats_student.ipynb) in Jupyter.
