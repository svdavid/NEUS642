    "#### The Spatial Selectivity of Cortical Neurons\n",

    "Localization of sound is important for both communication and survival, as it plays a key role in knowing to whom and towards where one should focus their attention. The ability to localize sound is also very useful for pinpointing sounds in loud environments. How well a person or animal can perceive the surrounding sounds depends on how the audio they are receiving is being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several places along the ascending audiotory pathway where neurons react to spatial cues. One of these areas is the auditory cortex, though the neurons of this area tend to be more broadly spatially tuned when compared to neurons of other auditory system locations. However, it has also been found that inactivation of the auditory cortex can lead to sound localization impairment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to determine how spatial processing takes place in the auditory cortex is by observing the tuning curve and PSTH created by neurons when exposed to stimuli, as this gives us an idea of their spatial selectivity. The A1 cortical neurons have been said to react best to stimuli from the contralateral side, while other cortical neurons may react more or less to both lateral stimuli.\n",

    "The dataset of this notebook was pulled from a larger set of neurons recorded from ferret auditory cortex. In this experiment, two noise sounds were played from speakers positioned left and right of the midline. Both noises had the same spectral properties, but the level of the sounds changed randomly and independently over the course of each trial. Changing the relative level of the two sounds creates a dynamic inter-aural level difference (ILD), which produces a percept of a single source moving in space. This approach allows the study of \"fusion\", the process by whcih two sounds are perceived as a single sound, combining properties of the two sources.\n",
