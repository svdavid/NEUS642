    "Remember the very first line of code we ran in the first class? It went something like...  \n",

    "\n",
    "It looks very simple. We tell the Python interpreter (just a fancy name given to programs that run code, like \"python3\" in your command line) to create the variable name int_number and assign to it 56. A variable is just a little chunk of the computer's memory reserved to store its name and a pointer to another piece of memory where its value is. But there's a catch: in Python, 56 is not simply an integer (or a chunk of memory containing the equivalent binary number 111000). It turns out that you've been using objects since the very beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In languages like C or Fortran, variables are very simple chunks of memory containing just the bare minimum information about it. In Python, everything is an object. An int is an object. When you type int_number = 56, Python instantiates an object of the class int and uses the name int_number to refer to this object. So what are classes? And what does instantiating an object mean? Why is there a distinction between methods and functions? And what are user-defined classes good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, are classes necessary for programming? In principle no. You can live your life without ever touching a class statement. But here are some reasons why it can be useful to know a bit about them. Here's a (not exhaustive) list of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conceptually, it can be easier to think in terms of classes;\n",
    "- Since everything is an object in Python... well, it helps to know where they come from;\n",
    "- If you write code, you read code and use other people's code. And most libraries are built around classes. The reason is that classes can be handy to keep large projects organized. So to understand other people's codes, you will most certainly need to know a minimum about classes;"
