# NEUS 642 Week 1: Install Anaconda, Python and Jupyter Notebooks; Getting Started in Python

Our first class is independent and self-paced. It has two major components: 1) get python installed and running on your computer and 2) work through the Getting Started tutorial. For students with some Python experience, these exercises might be trivial. You are also welcome to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks using a different system if you prefer.  However, anyone with limited experence should follow these steps and work through the exercises carefully, as they form a critical foundation for the rest of the class.

First thing, for background, read this [overview of Python and the Jupyter Notebook programming environment](AboutPython.md). Then follow the directions below.

## Installing Anaconda

Traditionally, getting Python installed and working properly has required a fairly sophisiticated understanding of computers and programming. Happily, Anaconda is a community-driven software management system developed specifically as a user-friendly system for getting programming languages, including Python, up and running without having to puzzle over things like LIBPATHS and version conflicts. 

1. [Download and install Anaconda, following instructions specific to your operating system.](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html). You should be able to perform a standard installation.

2. [Run Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/). You should read through the entire Getting Started guide, but focus on the section "Run Python in a Jupyter Notebook". You might try Jupyer Lab, which is basically a fancier version of Notebook.


## Getting Started Tutorial

Once you've got Python and Jupyer up and running, open the [Getting_Started_students.ipynb](Getting_Started_students.ipynb) notebook and work through the exercises. Feel free to play around with the example code, add cells, etc. This is your sandbox!

Note that this is the "student" version of the notebook, which leaves the answers to exercises blank. If you need to get the solution, look in [Getting_Started_answers.ipynb](Getting_Started_students.ipynb)
