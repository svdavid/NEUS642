# NEUS 642 Week 1: Install Anaconda, Python and Jupyter Notebooks; Getting Started in Python

Today's class is self-paced, and has two major components: 1) get python installed and running on your computer and 2) worth through the Getting Started tutorial. For students with some Python experience, these exercises might be trivial, but others should work through these exercises carefully, as they form a critical foundation for the rest of the class.

Before getting started, you should read this [overview of Python and the Jupyter Notebook programming environment](AboutPython.md). Then follow the directions below.

## Installing Anaconda

Traditionally, getting Python installed and working properly has required a fairly sophisiticated understanding of computers and programming. Happily, Anaconda is a software management system developed several years ago, which was designed specifically as a user-friendly system for getting programming languages, including Python, up and running without having to puzzle over things like LIBPATHS and version conflicts. 


## Getting Started Tutorial

Once Anaconda is set up, you should be ready to launch Jupyter Lab and getting started with Python!
