    "Remember the very first line of code we ran in the first class? It went something like...  \n",
    "> int_number = 56\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks quite simple. We tell the Python interpreter (just a fancy name given to programs that run code, like \"python3\" in your command line) to create the variable name int_number and assign to it 56. A variable is just a little chunk of the computer's memory reserved to store its name and a pointer to another piece of memory where its value is. But there's a catch: in Python, 56 is not simply an integer (or a chunk of memory containing the equivalent binary number 111000). It turns out that you've been using objects since the very beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In languages like C or Fortran, integers are simply small chunks of memory containing just the bare minimum information about it. In Python, everything is an object. An int is an object. When you type int_number = 56, Python instantiates an object of the class _int_ and refers to it by its name, int_number. So what are classes? And what does instantiating an object mean? Why is there a distinction between methods and functions? And what are user-defined classes good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, are classes necessary for programming? In principle no. You can live your life without ever touching a class statement. In fact, not all programming language are object-oriented. So why learn it? Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of reasons to learn at least the basics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conceptually, it can be easier to think in terms of classes. Programmers often think of objects as real-world objects, which helps to make a connection between the code and the real-world problem;\n",
    "- Since everything is an object in Python... well, it helps to know where they come from;\n",
    "- If you write code, you read code and use other people's code. And most libraries are built around classes. The reason for that is that classes can be handy to keep large projects organized. So to understand other people's codes you need to understand how classes are structured."
