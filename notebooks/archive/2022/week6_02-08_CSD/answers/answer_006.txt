# Answer

#initialize matrix
mua_trials = np.zeros((60, 64, int(1.6*1500)))

#loop through list of epochs and for each epoch extract 
for i in range(60):
    mua_trials[i, :] = mua[:, round(epochs_bins[i, 0]):round(epochs_bins[i, 1])]
    
#sanity check that data shape is correct
np.shape(mua_trials)
