Data are from five single units recorded simultaneously from awake ferret auditory cortex. Stimuli are narrowband noise. Noise with the same spectral band (600-900 Hz) was presented simultaneously from two speakers (channel 1: contra and channel 2: ipsi from the recording site). The envelope of the noise fluctuated with different timecourse from the two speakers, producing a percept of a single noise moving left and right in space.

file description:
* `<cellid>_psth.csv` - average response across trials
* `<cellid>_stim.csv` - envelope for contra and ipsi channels
* `<cellid>_raster.csv` - single trial response

interesting cells:  
* por026c-a1 : contra only response?
* por026c-b1 : contra+ipsi?
