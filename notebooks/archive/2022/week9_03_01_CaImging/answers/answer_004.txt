UV1f= 150 #frame number where first irradiation occurred
UV2f= 300
ypeakthreshold= 1.25 #only count peak if it is 1.25 larger, peak must be at least this value greater in y than signal before / after, mph 
xpeakthreshold= 2 #finds tallest peak and eliminates peak in x direction on either side of peak mpd,
